function Resolve-HtmlString {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Loads the renderer's user-visible strings and fills caller-supplied tokens.
    .DESCRIPTION
        See docs/html-architecture.md. strings.psd1 is the fourth data file and
        is deliberately outside settings.schema.psd1: the schema exists to type
        and range-check values, and a schema entry per string would hold a
        Default that is a second copy of the string itself.

        Caller-supplied values are merged over the file and then substituted
        into every string as {token}. Only caller tokens are filled here.
        Anything the browser knows at display time - a count, a name - is left
        as written for the page to fill, and a token nobody fills stays visible
        rather than collapsing to nothing.

        This is where the seam is paid for: the name of a command belonging to
        whatever program generated the report arrives as a value, so nothing
        below the seam has to know what that program is.
    .PARAMETER ConfigPath
        Directory holding the data files. Defaults to the module's own.
    .PARAMETER Value
        Caller-supplied strings, merged over the file and substituted as tokens.
