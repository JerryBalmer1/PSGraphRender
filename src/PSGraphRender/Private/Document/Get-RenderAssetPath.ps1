function Get-RenderAssetPath {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Resolves the full path of a file shipped alongside the module.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Resolves against $script:ModuleRoot, which both the dev loader and the
        generated .psm1 set at import time. Never use $PSScriptRoot here: it is
        per-file, so it points at Private/Html under the dev loader but at the
        module root in the built module. One of those would silently be wrong.

        Split out from Get-RenderAsset so that assets which are parsed
        rather than read as text - the .psd1 config files go through
        Import-PowerShellDataFile, which needs a path - share exactly one copy
        of this resolution and one error message.
    .PARAMETER Name
        Asset path relative to the module root, e.g.
        'TemplateSets/cytoscape/Config/theme.psd1' or 'TemplateSets/cytoscape'.
    .PARAMETER PathType
        Whether Name is expected to be a file or a directory. Template sets are
        directories, so both are legitimate here.
