# Skills

Four skills, holding what used to live as prose in `CLAUDE.md` or as nothing at
all. Each one exists because its absence produced a specific, recent failure.

A skill's body loads only when it is invoked, which is why a procedure belongs
here and a fact belongs in `CLAUDE.md`. The split is deliberate: **the skill
holds the ritual, `CLAUDE.md` holds the rule.** Duplicating either into the
other is the accretion `instruction-prune` exists to stop.

## The four

| Skill | Triggers on | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`iteration-close`](iteration-close/SKILL.md) | the end of any prompt cycle; `/iteration-close` | `meta-pattern`, `subsystem-charter`, `instruction-prune` |
| [`meta-pattern`](meta-pattern/SKILL.md) | invoked by `iteration-close`; something feeling familiar at a different scale | — |
| [`subsystem-charter`](subsystem-charter/SKILL.md) | a `Private/` directory reaching three files; any new top-level directory; the charter test failing | `meta-pattern` |
| [`instruction-prune`](instruction-prune/SKILL.md) | invoked by `iteration-close`, every iteration; the byte budget failing | — |

Two leaves, one root, one interior node. `meta-pattern` is reachable by two
paths and depends on nothing — that is deliberate, not incidental. It has to be
runnable when the build is red and the ledger cannot be written, because the
iterations worth recording a pattern from are disproportionately the ones that
went wrong.

## Why each exists

**`iteration-close` — because the ritual was unwritten and one part of it was
undocumented entirely.** Eight actions end every prompt cycle here. Seven were
prose scattered across three sections of `CLAUDE.md`; the eighth — staging and
committing with a message worth reading — was written down nowhere. A habit
nothing enforces is a habit one tired session ends, and one already did:
`git add -A` swept a stray `coverage.xml` into a commit titled `asdf`. The rules
now live in the **Commit** section of `CLAUDE.md`; the order of operations lives
in the skill.

**`meta-pattern` — because patterns were discovered and then lost.** The same
idea has been rediscovered at three different scales in this repository, and
each time it was written into whichever local comment happened to be in front of
the author: a doc-comment in `Test-KnowledgeDocument`, a rule in `NAMING.md`, a
paragraph in `CLAUDE.md`. Nothing collected them, so the next scale rediscovered
each one from scratch. The ledger records what happened to the store; nothing
recorded what the implementer understood. The two-scale bar is what keeps the
log from filling with one-off profundities.

**`subsystem-charter` — because the intent did not propagate downward.**
`docs/html-architecture.md` is the only subsystem charter and it exists because
a prompt asked for it. `Private/EditorLink/` and `Private/Knowledge/` are the
same shape — many files, a shared contract, a seam — and went two versions with
none. When the next child area appears the same thing happens: nothing, until
someone notices. `tests/Private/SubsystemCharter.Tests.ps1` turns the trigger
into a red build, so noticing is no longer required.

**`instruction-prune` — because `CLAUDE.md` only grew, and the first version of
this skill could not stop it.** 46,681 bytes at v0.3.0, monotonically
increasing, read in full before every session does anything. The v0.3.0 version
proposed *deletions* for a later iteration to apply, and idled: a counter-force
one turn behind a force that acts every turn is a formality with a good
conscience, and — the real reason — **deletion has a defender.** Every line was
written because something went wrong, so the honest answer to "may I delete
this" is almost always no. At v0.4.0 a prune became a **move down a tier**,
which loses nothing and so needs no defending, and the tier is capped by the
build. 46,681 → 18,544 bytes, nothing deleted.

## Frontmatter, and three traps in it

These follow the Claude Code skill frontmatter schema — every field is optional
and `description` is only recommended. See <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills>.

**`name` does not name the command.** For a personal or project skill the
command comes from the **directory**; `name` sets only the display label in
listings. Renaming a skill means renaming its directory — edit the field alone
and nothing changes, with no error to tell you so. (Plugin skills differ:
there `name` does set the last segment.)

**`when_to_use` is a hint, not a hook.** It is appended to `description` in the
skill listing, under a shared 1,536-character cap, and a model reads it and
decides. Nothing fires it. Where a rule must actually hold, back it with a test:
`subsystem-charter` has `tests/Private/SubsystemCharter.Tests.ps1` and
`instruction-prune` has `tests/Instructions.Tests.ps1`, and those are mechanisms.
The trigger column in the table above is not.

**None of the four declares `allowed-tools`, deliberately.** A project skill's
`allowed-tools` grant applies in any session that invokes it, including in a
folder that has never been trusted, so a checked-in skill pre-approving
`Bash(git *)` is a grant to every future clone of this repository. Read the
`allowed-tools` of any skill in a repo before running Claude Code there — and
think twice before adding one here. The prompts these skills produce go through
the normal permission flow instead.
