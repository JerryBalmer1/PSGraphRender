    # THE CEILING, in UTF-8 bytes.
    #
    # Bytes rather than lines: a section can double in density while shrinking
    # in lines, so lines measure the wrong thing. Bytes rather than characters
    # because bytes do not depend on how a host decodes the file.
    #
    # 13,659 is what the tier WEIGHS, measured the day this test was written.
    # CLAUDE.md claims 10,000 in its own prose; that number was asserted before
    # the file existed and has never once been true. A ceiling set to an
    # aspiration is a red test that gets deleted, so this establishes the
    # baseline instead of raising one.
    #
    # The ratchet governs everything after: this number follows the tier down
    # and never back up. Raising it needs a ledger entry saying why, and "we
    # needed more room" is not why. Iteration 2 prunes toward 10,000 and brings
    # this down with it - see the charter's extraction checklist.
    #
    # Bytes are still only a PROXY. They track roughly with tokens read per
    # session, which is the cost actually being paid. They say NOTHING about
    # whether the file is comprehensible: a file that trends downward in bytes
    # while getting harder to hold in your head has passed this gate and failed
    # its purpose.

            Get-Item .Length would count a CRLF checkout 272 bytes heavier than
            the same file on Linux, so the gate would be one number on a
            developer's machine and another in CI. What is being budgeted is
            what the model reads, and that does not change with the checkout.
